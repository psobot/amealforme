# A Meal for Me #

What should I make for dinner?  *A Meal for Me* is a one-bite site, using the
Punchfork API, that tries to answer that question.  For more info, see [the
blog post](http://petersobot.com/blog/a-site-for-dinner) or [visit the site
itself](http://amealfor.me).

## I want to build it! ##

Cool, a user! Make sure you've got 
    
    git clone git@github.com:psobot/amealforme.git
    cd amealforme
    bundle install
    rake

If you're running [Pow](http://pow.cx), you can do this afterwards:

    ln -s `pwd` ~/.pow/amealforme
    open http://amealforme.dev

Feel free to fork this project (no pun intended) and enjoy.
